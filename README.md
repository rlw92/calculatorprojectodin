My calculator project for the Odin project

I am going to try and emulate the same design calculator I have on my phone.

Steps:

1. design the layout using flexbox
have the screen in one div, the numbers in another div and the operators
wrapping around the numbers div.
2. compile the js code to produce the needed answers


I am having trouble coding the sequence needed for long equations with multiple operators.
