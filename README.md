My calculator project for the Odin project

I am going to try and emulate the same design calculator I have on my phone.

Steps:

1. design the layout using flexbox
have the screen in one div, the numbers in another div and the operators
wrapping around the numbers div.
2. compile the js code to produce the needed answers


I am having trouble coding the sequence needed for long equations with multiple operators.

Update:

So I have managed to get this bad boy working to the specifications set out on the odin project page. 
The calculator can take in multiple sums and operators and output the correct answer.
If a user tries to divide by zero an error message is displayed and the user is encouraged to clear and start again.
My head is completely fried at the moment from this project so I think for my sanity it would be best to continue on with the course.
In the future I think it would be wise to revisit this, clean it up and add the extra functions.
